# Pixel-Weather-ScreenSaver 0.1.1
Display the weather as your screensaver, retro style!

# How do I install it?
Simply drag all the files from the "Pre-Compiled Files" folder into your System32 or SysWOW64 folder on your computer. For the screensaver to work, it needs to be in a folder where Windows can see it (System32 or SysWOW64 are common places).
# Requires .Net Framework 4.6.1
Otherwise it probably won't work... Download it here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=49981
# How do I configure it?
Go to your "Screen Saver" settings on Windows and there should be a configure button.
# I found a bug
Report it in the issues section. Thats why it exists
# Does this work on Mac and Linux?
I HIGHLY doubt it. It's designed for Windows.
